## Description
Given three integers between 0 and 255, corresponding to the red, green, and blue channel values of a color, find the hex string for that color. You may use anything built into your programming language, such as for base conversion, but you can also do it manually.

```
hexcolor(255, 99, 71) => "#FF6347"  (Tomato)
hexcolor(184, 134, 11) => "#B8860B"  (DarkGoldenrod)
hexcolor(189, 183, 107) => "#BDB76B"  (DarkKhaki)
hexcolor(0, 0, 205) => "#0000CD"  (MediumBlue)
```
